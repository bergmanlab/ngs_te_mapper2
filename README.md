# <a name="intro"></a> Introduction
ngs_te_mapper2 is a re-implementation of the method for detecting transposable element (TE) insertions from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data originally described in [Linheiro and Bergman (2012) PLoS ONE 7(2): e30008](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030008). ngs_te_mapper2 uses a three-stage procedure to annotate non-reference TEs as the span of target site duplication (TSD), following the framework described in [Bergman (2012) Mob Genet Elements. 2:51-54](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/mge.19479).

- In the first stage, WGS reads are queried against a library of TE sequences to identify 'junction reads' that span the start/end of TE and genomic flanking sequences are retained. Such reads are often referred as 'split reads', although in reality these reads are not split in the resequenced genome.

- In the second stage, junction reads from each side of TE insertion identified in the first stage are separately aligned to a reference genome that is hard-masked with RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/) using the same TE library from stage one. Genome-wide coverage profiles are computed using samtools v1.9 and genomic intervals with enriched coverage from junction read clusters on the 5' and 3' side of TEs are annotated in bed format. Regions of overlap between intervals of junction read clusters on the 5' and 3' side of TEs define the locations of the TSDs for candidate non-reference TE insertions. The orientation of the TE is determined from the relative orientation of alignments of the junction reads to the reference genome and TE library. 

- In the third stage, all reads from the original whole genome shotgun sequence data are used to query against the same hard-masked reference genome as in stage two. This additional mapping step is necessary to obtain all reads that span the TE-flank junction, as well as identify if any reads are present for the alternative ``reference" haplotype that does not carry the TE insertion. For each candidate non-reference TE insertion site, number of junction reads covering 5' and 3' side of each candidate TE insertion are estimated as the number of soft-clipped reads overlapping a 10bp window on the 5' and 3' side of the TSD, respectively (Count_junction5' and Count_junction3'). Number of non-reference reads (Count_non_ref) were estimated as max(Count_junction5', Count_junction3'). Number of reference reads (Count_ref) were estimated as number of non-soft-clipped reads spanning the TSD with at least 3bp extension on both side. The allele frequency for non-reference TEs is heuristically estimated as Count_non-ref/(Count_non_ref + Count_ref).

- Reference TE insertions are detected using a similar strategy to non-reference insertions, independently of any reference TE annotation. The first stage in detecting reference TE insertions is identical to the first stage of detecting non-reference TE insertions described above. The second stage in identifying reference TE insertions involves alignment of the renamed, but otherwise unmodified, junction reads to the reference genome. Alignments of the complete junction read (i.e. non-TE and TE components) are clustered to identify the two ends of the reference TE insertion. The orientation of the reference TE is then determined from the relative orientation of alignments of the junction reads to the reference genome and TE library.

ngs_te_mapper2 is written in python3 and is designed to run on a Linux operating system.

# <a name="install"></a> Installation
### Install Miniconda
To install ngs_te_mapper2, the recommended way is using conda. If your system doesn't have conda installed, you could use following steps to install Miniconda (Python 3.X). For more on Conda: see the [Conda User Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html).
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O $HOME//miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda # silent mode
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$HOME/miniconda/bin" >> $HOME/.bashrc # add to .bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc

conda init # this step requires you to close and open a new terminal before it take effect
conda update conda # update conda
```
### Install ngs_te_mapper2 using conda (recommended)
The easiest way to install ngs_te_mapper2 is using conda. All software dependencies should automatically be installed during the ngs_te_mapper2 installation.
```
# We recommended installing ngs_te_mapper2 in a new conda environment
conda create -n ngs_te_mapper2 --channel bioconda ngs_te_mapper2

# Alternatively, you can install ngs_te_mapper2 in current active environment
conda install --channel bioconda ngs_te_mapper2
```
### Install ngs_te_mapper2 using pip
Alternatively, ngs_te_mapper2 can be installed using pip.
```
# Installing ngs_te_mapper2 using github repo
git clone git@github.com:bergmanlab/ngs_te_mapper2.git
cd ngs_te_mapper2
pip install .

# Alternatively, you can install ngs_te_mapper2 hosted in pypi
pip install ngs_te_mapper2
```
The pip installation doesn't include software dependencies to run ngs_te_mapper2. We recommend using following steps to install all the software dependencies using conda.
```
git clone git@github.com:bergmanlab/ngs_te_mapper2.git
cd ngs_te_mapper2
conda env create -f envs/ngs_te_mapper2.yml
```

## Run ngs_te_mapper2 on test dataset
A test dataset is provided in the `test/` directory, you can test whether your ngs_te_mapper2 installation is successful by running ngs_te_mapper2 on this dataset, which should take less than one minute to finish on a single thread machine.
```
conda activate ngs_te_mapper2
cd test
ngs_te_mapper2 -o test_output -f reads.fastq -r ref_1kb.fasta -l library.fasta
```
NOTE: Sometimes activating conda environments does not work via conda activate myenv when run through a script submitted to a queueing system, this can be fixed by activating the environment in the script as shown below
```
CONDA_BASE=$(conda info --base)
source ${CONDA_BASE}/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate ngs_te_mapper2
```

# <a name="run"></a> Usage
## ngs_te_mapper2 required input files

Note: The optional reference TE annotation input should in theory speed up the program. ngs_te_mapper2 expects the TE annotation to be in [GFF3 format](https://m.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff3.html) and `Target` attribute must be included in the 9th column that represents TE family name. If you have `*.out` annotation generated by RepeatMasker, you can use this [utility script](https://www.repeatmasker.org/utils/rmOutToGFF3.pl) to convert from `*.out` to GFF3 format.
